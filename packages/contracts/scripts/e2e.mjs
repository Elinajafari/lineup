// again, with no key: every transaction's receipt must still say what the
// record says (executed, or refused with the same sentence), and every show
// and ticket must read back exactly as recorded. Every demo show is settled,
// so nothing on them can change after the record was written. It prints PASS
// or FAIL per check and exits non-zero on any FAIL, so a record that drifted
// from the chain cannot sit in the repo looking verified.
